## Voice Biomarker Validation @ LORIA

Starting January 2026, I am working as a research assistant at the Université de Lorraine's LORIA laboratory ("Lorraine Research Laboratory in Computer Science and its Applications").  This project focuses on the analytical and clinical validation of vocal biomarkers to ensure that digital speech features accurately map to physiological behaviors rather than acoustic noise. Alongside my team, I am responsible for designing validation protocols and engineering Python pipelines that account for demographic cofactors (like age and gender) to improve diagnostic accuracy.

## Wordification

Wordification is a project from ScholasTech, LLC and the University of South Carolina to create personalized spelling instruction and practice for K-8 students.  In order to teach literacy, we prioritize skills of phonics awareness and offer dialect-enhanced instruction.  Wordification is a first of its kind in that its educational materials are catered and personalized to speakers of different dialects.

## DetectErreur

DetectErreur is a digital tool designed to assist learners of French as a second language. By coding the rules of the French language into Python as well as utilizing machine learning methods, this tool detects writing errors, offers corrections, and provides pedagogically relevant feedback using Mistral NeMo 12B. Developing this tool allowed me to learn first-hand how to use Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) as these methods were applied to generate feedback that cited the rules of French directly.  DetectErreur was completed for the Master 1 Semester 1 project at the Université de Lorraine.
