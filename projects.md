## Wordification

Wordification is a project from ScholasTech, LLC and the University of South Carolina to create personalized spelling instruction and practice for K-8 students.  In order to teach literacy, we prioritize skills of phonics awareness and offer dialect-enhanced instruction.  Wordification is a first of its kind in that its educational materials are catered and personalized to speakers of different dialects.

## DetectErreur

DetectErreur is a digital tool designed to assist learners of French as a second language. By coding the rules of the French language into Python as well as utilizing machine learning methods, this tool detects writing errors, offers corrections, and provides pedagogically relevant feedback using Mistral NeMo 12B. Developing this tool allowed me to learn first-hand how to use Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) as these methods were applied to generate feedback that cited the rules of French directly.  DetectErreur was completed for the Master 1 Semester 1 project at the Université de Lorraine.
