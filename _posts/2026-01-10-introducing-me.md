I am a Master's of Science student at Université de Lorraine studying _Natural Language Processing_.  In other words, I study how computers can better understand human language in order for digital tools to improve our lives.

I am a student of the Erasmus Mundus Language & Communication Technology of the European Union.  In this double degree program, I will receive two MSc degrees in Natural Language Processing, one from Université de Lorraine in Nancy, France (2025-2026) and one from the Universidad de País Vasco (2026-2027).

My primary interests these days focus on the application of AI in language education, machine learning, and the specialization of small language models.  Beyond NLP, I have also conducted a thesis on syntax, discourse analysis, and Singaporean English.
